Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they make web applications work well, resilient, and perform better across different browsers and network conditions. Service workers use graceful degradation to keep the app working even when there are issues with things like the network. This allows it to work even when offline. Graceful degradation is starting with max technology and addressing lower levels with grace which means the app can function well when there are issues, like when service workers handle network requests and manage our cache offline and the app still works well.
